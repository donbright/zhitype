A unicode TrueType(TM) font renderer for microcontrollers and e-paper

(Note: TrueType(TM) is a trademark and usage here does not imply endorsement)

Goals

1. very very simple code, skip unnecessary steps
2. keep code size small
3. don't try to work with every TTF file, just the basic ones

Notes

0. tradeoff portability, speed, error-checking+security, for small memory usage
1. goal 2 results in lots of ifdefs
2. use C++ but use it as if it were C. no classes, STL, etc.
3. no objects, no class hierarchy, no nothin'.
4. treat font file as a streaming object we can pull off an SD card
5. don't care about pixel tweaking at low resolutions. because
5.a. e-paper is high res so you wont have the same problems as old monitors
5.b. e-paper is generally only two colors (black/white) so it wont help
5.c. the code is so complicated it wont be doable on microcontrollers?
6. pretend we are reading from an SD card, which on arduino means one
 byte at a time.
8. DEBUG can be turned on for testing inside of a computer, like
 on linux. DEBUG can be turned off to chop down code size and for porting
 to Arduino libraries.
9. avoid use of pointers, use C++ pass by reference, to cut down on errors
 and possible crashes.
10. cannot store full data of points in memory, there isnt enough memory.
 40 points could be 400 bytes, our SRAM is 2k on an arduino.
 process points as a stream. using fseek(). slow but it might work.
11. a lot of error checking has to be skipped (checksums for example)
12. try not to use heap memory at all
13. trade time for memory. this is why fseek() is everywhere.


Things Not Supported:

Which 'CMAPs' are supported?
( https://developer.apple.com/fonts/TrueType-Reference-Manual/RM06/Chap6cmap.html )

A1. Unicode Only
A2. Formats 4 6 and 12 only
A3. There will be no error reporting due to code size requirements being
 tiny.

Simple glyphs only, no Compound Glyphs are supported.

FreeType's glyph loader is in a file named 'ttgload.c', which you can google.
(it's in dozens of projects). See http://freetype.org



How does TrueType work?

There are two main tables we care about. CMAP and GLYF.
CMAP is a map from, say, unicode, to a position in the file with the glyph.
The GLYF table contains all the points to draw the characters.

But... GLYF is kind of special. It is designed to squeeze the most
information in the least amount of space. How?

1. It is essentially Run Length Encoded kinda like the old PCX picture format.
The coordinates can be 'repeated' and the flag (which indicates info about a)
 point) can also be 'repeated'. If you had 4 x-coordinates in a row and
they were each 16 bit numbers, this could save like 3 bytes. If you have
dozens of fonts with hundreds of characters each, this space savings adds up,
in theory.

2. Coordinates are relative to the previous coordinate, not to an
origin. If you ponder it for a while, you will perhaps notice that this
tends to cut down on the size of the numbers ( for example if i have 3
points, 1000,200 1024,201 1048,210 i can save several ASCII digits by
saying  1000,200 +24,1    +24,9. Same is true with binary digits.

3. Coordinates can be either 16 bit signed, or 8 bit unsigned. But there
is a trick. There is a 'sign' bit in the 'flag' for 8 bit numbers....
.. so they are actually 9-bit signed integers! Clever.

All of this space-packing makes te unpacking code a bit complicated.

On the mathematics of the Bezier Curve

Or... how to draw Bezier Curves without using multiplication, division,
floating point numbers, or other abominations of modern savagery.
(So that we might not assault our poor microcontroller with operations
requiring dozens of clockcycles)

0. Read the wikipedia article about Beziers. Now tear it up and throw it away.

1. Next, almost everything you ever learned in school about geometry

2. OK, now forget that algebra exists, Cartesian coordiantes OK, algebra no.

3. The bezier curve is a conic section. It's a parabola.

4. Parabola is the same thing you get when you throw a ball in the air and
 it comes back to earth.

5. It is quite easy to draw a ball in the air without using
multiplication, division, or floating point. Consider a ball with an x
coordinate and y coordinate.

 A. set y accelleration = -9.8
 B. run in a loop:
   x position = x position + 1
   y position = y position + y velocity
   y velocity = y velocity + y accelleration
   draw a point at x,y

This will produce a perfectly nice parabola.

Note that by setting accelleration to a constant we are essentially
simulating gravity. All of the calculus and stuff (dy/dt) is basically
saying the same thing. But this is alot simpler.

Notice, there is no multiplication, division, equations, squares, sqrts,
transcendentals, irrationals, sin, cosine, etc etc etc. It's just addition
and subtraction.

And thus we have drawn a Bezier curve using only addition and subtraction.

And... every bezier curve is a parabola.


The question is... how to take this simple situation on plain x-y coordinates
and translate it to the Beziers as used in TrueType(TM) fonts? Those Beziers
are given as... three points. Two 'on points' and one 'control point'. How
does this work?


Step 1. Find the directrix and focus of the Parabola. What's a directrix
and focus? Go back to the Greeks and the 18th century school of Conics...
and then come back.

For any parabola, and two points on it, you can imagine it traces
the trajectory of a ball thrown..... where the Force upon it, the gravity
if you will, is directly perpendicular in dirction to the Directrix.

See? Now, of course, x cannot just be incremented by one anymore. . .
and Y cannot be incremented by a simple velocity/acceleration addition. Why?
Because sometimes the parabola will be rotated with respect to the x-axis
and y-axis plane. It will be facing maybe 30 degrees or whatever.

But what we can do.... is look at the force-accelleration and the X velocity
as vectors. Now, break them down into their x and y pieces to match our
main coordinate system. For example if the directrix is heading on a slope
from 0,0 to 3,4, then you can think of it as a vector with two parts. 
(3,0) and (4,0). Now. We can add a fraction of this each loop and we will
hopefuly get the resulsts sti.
